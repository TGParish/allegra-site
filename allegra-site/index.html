        Enjoy the svg above that I stole from wikipedia and added an infinite
        loop animation to.

        I recieved your letter in the post, thankfully it was forwarded to me or
        I would have missed a special artifact.

        I was going to break out the ol' feather and ink but I've been told my
        hand writing is basically untranslateble and I don't have a typewriter
        because I'm a reverse luddite. I will send one soon but for now,
        consider this an e-letter.

        Thank you for your brilliant letter, it was a nice surprise and a great
        reassurance of my 27th year-- which may be my last so that I may join
        the ranks of the titular club, where a fella named Aaron Hernandez is a
        member. He committed suicide I guess because football hurt his head or
        something.

        Thank you for your companionship after all these years. We are like the
        hobbits at the end of The Lord of the Rings: after being through hell
        and high-tide, nothing scares us anymore and reclaiming The Shire from
        the clutches or our <b id="haters">HATERS.</b> ain't no thing but a
        chicken wing.

        Perhaps were are astronomically entertwined and meant to meet in every
        microchasm of life. Two spiders in a web we think we're spinning, only
        to realize we are but two cogs in an endless system.
